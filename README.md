Iris Classification with SVM and GridSearch

Description:
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the classification of Iris species using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimized with GridSearch. The Iris dataset, a famous dataset in pattern recognition, includes measurements from three species of Iris flowers.

Overview

The notebook explores the following key aspects:

Loading and displaying the Iris dataset.
Performing exploratory data analysis, including visualizations of the different species.
Using seaborn for advanced visualizations like pair plots and KDE plots.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training an SVM model on the Iris data.
Evaluating the model's performance with confusion matrices and classification reports.
Using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the SVM, enhancing model performance.
